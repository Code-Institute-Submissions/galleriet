# Galleriet - Buy original paintings online

This is my fifth and final project with Code Institute. Galleriet is a B2C (Business to Customer) e-commerce application which sells paintings online. This application has been created using the Django framework. It is targeted towards individual customers that are interested in art and want to purchase original paintings from the best emerging artists around the world.

This project is for educational purposes only!
